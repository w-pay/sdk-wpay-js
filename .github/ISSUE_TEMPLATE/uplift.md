**What version of the API spec does the SDK need to target**

(Make sure to change the title of the issue)

**Checklist**

- [ ] Add/update models
- [ ] Add/update API interface definitions
- [ ] Add tests (if required) for new functionality
- [ ] Bump version of lib - is this a minor version bump?

Submit the PR.

Note: The CI pipeline will take care of regenerating docs, and the distribution so this is not
required pre merge.
